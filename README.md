Zabbix Cisco Catalyst 9300 "Monster" TemplateAdvanced monitoring template for Cisco Catalyst 9300 (IOS-XE) switches using Zabbix 7.4+.This template goes beyond standard SNMP monitoring by utilizing SSH-based data collection to retrieve deep "Device Tracking" (SISF) information that is often missing or incomplete in standard SNMP MIBs on modern IOS-XE versions.🚀 Key Features1. 🕵️‍♂️ Advanced Device Tracking (SSH-based)Standard SNMP (IP-MIB or CISCO-IP-DEVICE-TRACKING-MIB) often fails to report all connected devices on newer IOS-XE versions. This template uses a secure SSH connection to parse the show device-tracking database CLI output directly.Complete Visibility: Sees ALL connected endpoints (DHCP Snooping, ARP, ND, Static).Accuracy: successfully retrieves 164+ entries where SNMP typically shows only ~9.2. 🗺️ Port-to-IP Mapping (Neighbor Discovery)Automatically discovers active ports and lists the connected IP addresses directly in the interface statistics.Item Name: Interface Gi1/0/x: Neighbor IP Address(es)Value: IPv4: 192.168.1.50 | IPv6: 2001:db8::50No need to cross-reference MAC address tables manually!3. 🚨 IP Conflict Monitor (The "Police")A built-in logic that analyzes the entire Device Tracking database for inconsistencies.Detects: Duplicate IP addresses associated with different MAC addresses.Smart IPv6 Filtering: Ignores Link-Local (fe80::) addresses to prevent false positives, focusing only on Global Unicast / ULA conflicts.Trigger: Fires a HIGH severity alert immediately upon detecting a conflict (e.g., "CONFLICT: 192.168.1.10 [MAC1 vs MAC2]").4. 📊 Standard Hardware Health (SNMP)Includes all the essentials:CPU & Memory usage.Temperature & Fan status.Stack Ring Redundancy & Member monitoring.Interface traffic & status.🛠️ PrerequisitesZabbix Server: Version 7.4 or higher (required for the import format and UUIDs).Configuration: The Zabbix Server/Proxy must have Timeout set to at least 30 seconds in zabbix_server.conf.Reason: SSH commands and parsing large tables on the switch can take time.Switch Config:SNMP enabled (RO).SSH enabled.device-tracking (formerly IPDT/SISF) feature enabled on the switch ports.⚙️ Installation & Configuration1. Import the TemplateDownload the .json file from this repository and import it into Zabbix (Data collection -> Templates -> Import).2. Set MacrosLink the template to your Cisco 9300 Host and set the following Inherited Macros:MacroDescriptionType{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}SNMP Read CommunityText{$SSH_USER}Username for SSH LoginText{$SSH_PASSWORD}Password for SSH LoginSecret Text3. Verify DataGo to Monitoring -> Latest Data and filter by the tag Monitoring: IP Monitor or Application: Zabbix Raw Data.Check SSH: Device Tracking Database (CLI): Should contain a valid JSON string.Check Net: IP Conflict Monitor: Should report "OK".🧠 How it Works (Under the Hood)Hybrid Data CollectionMaster Item (SSH): The template logs into the switch via SSH and executes:Bashshow device-tracking database | exclude ^$
JavaScript Preprocessing: Zabbix parses the raw CLI text output into a structured JSON object containing IP, MAC, VLAN, Interface, and State.Low-Level Discovery (LLD):The Active Ports Discovery rule iterates through this JSON.It creates dependent items for every active interface (e.g., Gi1/0/1).It populates these items with the connected IPv4/IPv6 addresses.Conflict Logic: A separate dependent item scans the JSON for any IP keys that have multiple distinct MAC addresses assigned to them.🚧 Roadmap / To-DoQoS Discovery: Parsing show policy-map interface to visualize dropped packets and class-map statistics (Work in Progress).PoE Monitoring: Advanced power budget detailed stats.🤝 ContributingThis template was forged in the fires of debugging IOS-XE SNMP limitations.
